# Overview
Welcome to my analysis of the data job market, with a focus on trends and skills. This project, which was created to better understand the current landscape of the data industry, delves into the top job roles, geographical demand, and the most sought-after skills and their corresponding salaries.
The analysis is based on a dataset of job postings in 2023.
The data sourced from [Luke Barousse's Python Course](https://lukebarousse.com/python) which provides a foundation for my analysis, containing detailed information on job titles, salaries, locations, and essential skills. Through a series of Python scripts, I explore key questions such as the most demanded skills, job posting trends, and the intersection of demand and salary to identify optimal skills for data scientists.

# The Questions

1. What are the most popular job roles and which countries have the most job postings?

2. How are job postings for top roles like Data Analyst, Data Engineer, and Data Scientist trending over the year in the United States?

3. What are the most in-demand skills for each of these roles?

4. How do skills correlate with salary, and what are the most optimal skills for a Data Scientist to have?
