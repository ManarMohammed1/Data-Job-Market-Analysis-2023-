# Overview
Welcome to my analysis of the data job market, with a focus on trends and skills. This project, which was created to better understand the current landscape of the data industry, delves into the top job roles, geographical demand, and the most sought-after skills and their corresponding salaries.

The analysis is based on a dataset of job postings from 2023. Through a series of Python scripts, I explore key questions such as:

1. What are the most popular job roles and which countries have the most job postings?

2. How are job postings for top roles like Data Analyst, Data Engineer, and Data Scientist trending over the year in the United States?

3. What are the most in-demand skills for each of these roles?

4. How do skills correlate with salary, and what are the most optimal skills for a Data Scientist to have?

This project provides insights into the skills that are both high in demand and offer high median salaries, helping to identify lucrative career paths and skill development opportunities in the data field.
